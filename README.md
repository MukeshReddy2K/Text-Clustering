we used k-means clustering and 
hierarchical clustering to group blog posts or news 
articles from the Daily Kos political blog. We used both 
hierarchical and KMeans methods to extract the top six 
words from each of the seven clusters that were provided 
in the problem statement. Overall, we were able to 
identify significant themes and subjects in the Daily Kos 
political blog and group-related articles based on their 
content using our clustering analysis. This could be 
useful for conducting further research on topics or issues 
or for organizing and presenting articles to readers.
